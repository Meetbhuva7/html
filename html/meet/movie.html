    <p>Cinema is very common in India. Everyone is entertained by cinema and enjoys it for nearly three hours. <br>
        Cinema came into existence in <b>1930</b>. At first silent and black & white movies were made. <br> After that
        coloured movies were made. Seeing a movie is not at all costly as compared to the other sources of
        entertainment. That is why everyone likes to see a film in a cinema hall. Cinema has its merits and demerits
        too. If a person sees a bad film then he can adopt all the bad points of the film. <br> To see too much of films
        can spoil our eyesight, waste our money, time and energy. A person who beÂ­comes a film fan wants to see every
        film at any cost, which is not at all good. <br> Now-a-days cinema has become very popular and it is a good
        source of entertainment.</p>
