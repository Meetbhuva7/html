    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are <b> organized</b> and <strong> coherent </strong>, and are all
        related to a single topic.
        <hr><br> Almost every piece of writing you do that is <i> longer</i> than a few <em> sentences</em> should be
        organized into paragraphs.
        <hr><br> This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay <u> begin</u> and <u>
            end</u>.
        <hr><br> and thus help the reader see the organization of the <mark> essay</mark> and <mark> grasp</mark> its
        main points.
